The repository includes detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application locally. This makes it easy for developers to get started with the code and make modifications as needed. Overall, Pug.js Single E-commerce Master is a great resource for developers looking to learn how to build a single-page e-commerce application using Pug.js and the MERN stack.
